<br>
I've built a calculator website which performs basic functions such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. It has a display screen to display the userâ€™s input and give the results. 
<br>
A blurred-effect background image has been added to make the website look appealing!

Tech stack used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
